            <p> Hi {name}!  <br><br>
            
                We wanted to wish you an amazing and prosperous 2022 from our panda family to yours ðŸŽ‰ <br>
                I am reaching out to you because we are looking for new collabs and our 2022 brand ambassadors, and weâ€™re hoping that you could be a part of it! <br>
                We are looking to increase our reach on social media, and throughout 2021 we realised that video content is what gets people engaged the most.<br>
                This time around we are looking for original, authentic content from our influencers specifically by creating reels, stories, or anything in video format. <br>
                All that said, would you be interested in joining us on a new collab? If so, let me know and I'll send you more info ðŸ¥° <br><br>
                Best,<br>
                The Pink Panda team
